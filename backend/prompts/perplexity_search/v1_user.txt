Perform a focused web search about the company: {company_name}.

Your task:
- Summarize **verified** information from credible sources (official website, Crunchbase, TechCrunch, academic articles, or news).
- Emphasize key data points investors care about:
  - Founding year, founders, advisors, investors, funding rounds, and partners
  - Product or technology focus (especially IP, patents, and differentiators)
  - Clinical trials, regulatory milestones, or market traction (if applicable)
- Keep it **concise** (5â€“7 sentences, factual tone, no repetition).
- For every factual statement, **include an inline clickable citation in markdown** right after the claim.  
  Example: The company raised $3.5M in seed funding [[Crunchbase](https://crunchbase.com/company/abc)].
- Do **not** add headings, bullet points, or commentary.
