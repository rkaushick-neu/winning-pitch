      "markdown": "giles@metamixis.com\n\nThis image is a visual representation of the core components that form \"metamixis,\" likely a company or concept. It uses a clean, modern design with a dark background and contrasting colored circles and text.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Overall Structure:**\nThe image features three large circles at the top, each representing a distinct field or discipline. These circles are connected by lines to a central concept or entity at the bottom, \"metamixis.\"\n\n**Top Circles (Inputs/Components):**\n\n1.  **Left Circle (Gray):**\n    *   **Icon:** A white outline of a laptop computer, indicating \"Computation.\" The screen shows a few horizontal lines, suggesting data or code.\n    *   **Text:** \"Computation\" is written in white below the icon.\n    *   **Meaning:** This circle represents the role of computational power, data processing, and algorithms.\n\n2.  **Middle Circle (Blue):**\n    *   **Icon:** A white outline of a conical flask or beaker with bubbles rising from within, symbolizing \"Synthetic Biology.\"\n    *   **Text:** \"Synthetic Biology\" is written in white below the icon.\n    *   **Meaning:** This central circle highlights the field of synthetic biology, which involves designing and constructing new biological parts, devices, and systems, or re-designing existing natural biological systems for useful purposes.\n\n3.  **Right Circle (Gray):**\n    *   **Icon:** A white outline of a robotic arm with a gripper, and a Wi-Fi or signal icon above it, representing \"Automation.\"\n    *   **Text:** \"Automation\" is written in white below the icon.\n    *   **Meaning:** This circle signifies the importance of automated processes, robotics, and potentially AI-driven systems.\n\n**Connecting Lines:**\nThree gray lines originate from the bottom of each of the top circles. These lines converge and point downwards, leading to the \"metamixis\" logo. This visually suggests that \"Computation,\" \"Synthetic Biology,\" and \"Automation\" are the foundational elements or inputs that combine to create or define \"metamixis.\"\n\n**Bottom Element (Output/Result):**\n\n*   **Logo/Text:** \"metamixis\" is written in a stylized, lowercase, blue font. To the right of the text is a circular logo composed of interconnected lines forming a complex, almost cellular or network-like pattern within a circle.\n*   **Meaning:** This is the central subject of the diagram, implying that \"metamixis\" is a concept, company, or product that integrates or leverages computation, synthetic biology, and automation. The logo reinforces the idea of interconnectedness and complexity, possibly related to biological or digital networks.\n\n**Color Scheme:**\nThe use of dark gray for the background and some elements, combined with a vibrant blue for \"Synthetic Biology\" and the \"metamixis\" logo, creates a professional and technologically oriented aesthetic. The blue might emphasize synthetic biology as a core or distinguishing component, or simply be part of the brand's color palette.\n\nIn summary, the image effectively communicates that \"metamixis\" is an entity or endeavor that arises from the synergistic combination of computation, synthetic biology, and automation."

      "markdown": "This image presents a simplified infographic or diagram, likely illustrating key aspects or resources related to a \"customer\" or a customer-focused project. The overall aesthetic is clean and modern, with a dark background and light-colored text and icons.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Overall Structure and Color Scheme:**\n*   The background is a solid, dark charcoal gray or very dark blue.\n*   All text and graphical elements are in shades of white or light gray, providing strong contrast and readability.\n*   The layout is vertical, with three main categories listed on the left and corresponding visual representations or data points on the right.\n\n**Top Section: \"customer\" Header**\n*   At the very top, centered, is the word \"customer\" in a clean, sans-serif font. This acts as the overarching title or subject of the diagram.\n\n**Main Content Sections (from top to bottom):**\n\n1.  **STAFF:**\n    *   On the left, in a large, bold, sans-serif font, is the word \"STAFF\".\n    *   Extending to the right from \"STAFF\" is a leaf-shaped or teardrop-shaped graphic, filled with a lighter shade of gray.\n    *   Inside this graphic, there are two rows of white stick figures, representing people. Each row has 7 figures, totaling 14 figures. These figures are generic and gender-neutral, often used to symbolize a group of individuals or employees. This visually represents the quantity of staff involved.\n\n2.  **EQUIPMENT:**\n    *   Below \"STAFF\", on the left, is the word \"EQUIPMENT\" in the same large, bold font.\n    *   Again, a similar leaf-shaped graphic extends to the right, also filled with a lighter gray.\n    *   Inside this graphic, the text \"$1-3M\" is displayed in a large, bold, white font. This likely represents a cost or value range for the equipment.\n\n3.  **TIMELINE:**\n    *   The final section, on the left, shows the word \"TIMELINE\" in the consistent large, bold font.\n    *   A third leaf-shaped graphic extends to the right, filled with the same light gray.\n    *   Inside this graphic, the text \"3 years\" is prominently displayed in a large, bold, white font. This indicates the duration or timeframe associated with the project or customer interaction.\n\n**Visual Metaphor/Design:**\n*   The leaf or teardrop shapes could symbolize growth, resources, or perhaps a flow of information/value from the main category. Their consistent shape and size create a unified visual language for the data points.\n*   The overall design is minimalist and effective at conveying key information quickly.\n\nIn summary, the image is a concise visual summary, likely for a business presentation or internal communication, outlining the staff, equipment costs, and timeline associated with a particular \"customer\" or customer-centric initiative.\n\nThis image is a dark-themed infographic or slide with three distinct sections, each represented by a leaf-like shape connected to a text label by a horizontal line. The background is a solid dark gray or black.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of each section:\n\n1.  **Top Section (Staff):**\n    *   **Leaf Shape:** A blue, leaf-like shape is on the left. Inside this shape, there's a white icon of a person (specifically, a female figure with a skirt) surrounded by several chevron or arrow-like patterns pointing to the right.\n    *   **Connecting Line:** A gray horizontal line extends from the right side of the blue leaf.\n    *   **Text Label:** To the right of the line, in large white sans-serif font, is the word \"STAFF\".\n\n2.  **Middle Section (Equipment):**\n    *   **Leaf Shape:** A gray, leaf-like shape is on the left. Inside this shape, in white sans-serif font, is \"$0.01M\". Below this text, there are also several chevron or arrow-like patterns pointing to the right, similar to the top section.\n    *   **Connecting Line:** A gray horizontal line extends from the right side of the gray leaf.\n    *   **Text Label:** To the right of the line, in large white sans-serif font, is the word \"EQUIPMENT\".\n\n3.  **Bottom Section (Timeline):**\n    *   **Leaf Shape:** A blue, leaf-like shape is on the left. Inside this shape, in white sans-serif font, is \"1/3 year\". Below this text, there are also several chevron or arrow-like patterns pointing to the right, similar to the other sections.\n    *   **Connecting Line:** A gray horizontal line extends from the right side of the blue leaf.\n    *   **Text Label:** To the right of the line, in large white sans-serif font, is the word \"TIMELINE\".\n\nOverall, the image uses a consistent visual style with leaf-like icons, connecting lines, and clear text labels to present three key categories: Staff, Equipment, and Timeline, along with associated values or indicators. The chevron patterns within the leaves suggest direction or perhaps progress.\n\n# customer\n\n## STAFF\n\n- **EQUIPMENT**: $1-3M\n- **TIMELINE**: 3 years\n\n# sales\n\n- **2018**: $0.01M\n- **2019**: $0.01M\n- **2020**: $0.01M\n\n# metamixis\n\n- **STAFF**\n- **EQUIPMENT**\n- **TIMELINE**"
