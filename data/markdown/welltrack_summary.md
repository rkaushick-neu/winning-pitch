## Market Landscape

## Investment Rationale

WellTrack demonstrates strong traction within the university mental health sector, evidenced by its \$400,000 ARR and partnerships with over 70 universities, including prominent institutions like Penn State and UC San Diego. The acquisition by ProtoCall Services provides a strategic advantage by integrating digital self-help tools with 24/7 human clinician support, creating a comprehensive solution for student mental health. This integration addresses a critical need for scalable and accessible mental health resources in higher education, a market with significant demand and spending. The experienced team, led by a psychology professor, brings relevant expertise to the product's development and clinical foundation.

## Risks / Open Questions
