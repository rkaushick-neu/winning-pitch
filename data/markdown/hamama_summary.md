## Overview

Hamama is a West Sacramento-based startup that provides a consumer-focused, "fail-proof" system for growing microgreens indoors year-round. The company aims to offer easy access to fresh, nutritious greens for home users through proprietary technology that simplifies the growing process [[StartupSac](https://startupsac.com/from-mit-to-microgreens-hamama-ceo-camille-richman/)].

## Founders & Team

The team consists of:
*   **Camille Richman**: Co-founder and CEO. She holds an engineering degree from MIT Media Lab.
*   **Daniel Goodman**: Co-founder. He is also an MIT alumnus.

Both founders met as mechanical engineering students at MIT, where they researched high-tech indoor agriculture. They had prior experience growing food in lab and home settings before co-founding Hamama in 2016 [[StartupSac](https://startupsac.com/from-mit-to-microgreens-hamama-ceo-camille-richman/)].

## Technology & IP

Hamama's core technology is a "fail-proof" system designed to enable indoor, year-round microgreen cultivation without requiring gardening experience [[StartupSac](https://startupsac.com/from-mit-to-microgreens-hamama-ceo-camille-richman/)]. The system utilizes "Seed QuiltsÂ®" which are pre-seeded mats. Examples of Seed Quilts include Salad Mix, Cabbage, Radish, Wheatgrass, Broccoli, Zesty Mix, Kale, Clover, Arugula, and Fenugreek. While the technology is described as "seemingly simple but very powerful science," no explicit details on patents or IP filings are publicly available [[Social Starts](https://www.socialstarts.com/blog/inception-with-camille-richman-ceo-of-hamama/)].

## Product & Traction

Hamama offers kits that allow consumers to grow microgreens at home. The "Starter Kit" is priced at $35 and includes a black tray, instructions, and various "seed quilts" such as Super Salad Mix, Refreshing Cabbage, and Spicy Daikon Radish. The company also offers a "Monthly Seed Quilts" subscription for $17/month. The product aims for ease of use and consistent results, requiring minimal effort from the user [[StartupSac](https://startupsac.com/startup-happy-hour-with-camille-richman-co-founder-of-hamama/)].

Traction:
*   **Revenue**: $240K in 2018, $180K YTD (as of pitch deck creation).
*   **Growth**: 25% MoM Growth.
*   **Margins**: 50% margins on subscription products.
*   The company has achieved over $1 million in revenue [[StartupSac](https://startupsac.com/from-mit-to-microgreens-hamama-ceo-camille-richman/)].

## Market Landscape

The target market consists of home consumers seeking convenient, healthy, and sustainable food options, particularly those with limited outdoor space or gardening experience. The pitch deck states that 1 in 3 US households grows food, and $3.6B is spent on food gardening annually. Hamama differentiates itself from competitors like AeroGarden and Click & Grow by focusing on the simplicity and "fail-proof" nature of its system, making microgreen cultivation accessible to novices [[StartupSac](https://startupsac.com/from-mit-to-microgreens-hamama-ceo-camille-richman/)].

## Investment Rationale

*   **Experienced Founders**: The team comprises MIT-educated engineers with backgrounds in indoor agriculture research.
*   **Proven Traction**: Demonstrated revenue growth and a reported 50% margin on subscription products.
